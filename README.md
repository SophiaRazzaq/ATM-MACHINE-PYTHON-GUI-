Initially, a welcome screen will appear, and as I was coding, 
I incorporated a database with an ID of "ibrahim," a password of "7898," and an amount of 50,000. 
To run the program, simply enter this input.
There are many accounts in it.
An error message will be displayed if either the account name or password is incorrect.
If the account exists, three options will be presented: withdraw, deposit, and balance inquiry.
As operations are carried out, the amount will be updated accordingly.
